# Window Colors

Uniquely and automatically colors each VSCode window.

See settings for `Window Colors: Theme` to match Dark vs Light themes.

## How it works

When you open a folder in a new VSCode window, this extension picks some colors based on a hash of that folder's name.

Those colors are then saved in `.vscode/settings.json`.  You might want to add .vscode to .gitignore.  

If you don't like the colors picked by this extension, you can change them in `.vscode/settings.json`.  They don't get overwritten, so you have to either manually delete them, or select `revert` in the extension `Window Colors: Theme` settings and reload first in order to switch between `light` and `dark`.

Workspaces containing multiple root folders are not currently supported by this extension.  The current behavior for multi-folder workspaces is that the workspace color settings will be set by the first window opened, and can be saved in the workspace's `<workspace-name>.code-workspace` configuration file.

When opening new VSCode windows, you might see the relevant theme colors change as they are updated to the new workspace.  This is normal:

## Removal

After disabling or uninstalling this extension, removing these settings will return your window to the default theme:

`.vscode/settings.json:`
```javascript
 "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
      "activityBar.background": "#...",
      "titleBar.activeBackground": "#...",
      "titleBar.activeForeground": "#..."
    }
```
