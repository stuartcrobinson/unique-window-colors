TODO - commadn line stuff:


  process.argv.forEach(function (val, index, array) {
    console.log(index + ': ' + val);
  });

  console.log(JSON.stringify(process.argv))
  console.log(JSON.stringify(process.env))
  console.log(JSON.stringify(process.env.stuartcolor))
  // vscode.window.showInformationMessage(JSON.stringify(process.argv));
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(JSON.stringify(process.env));
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(JSON.stringify(process.env.stuartcolor));


  
TOOD - custom theme picker doesn't show after removing colors.  no exception either.




-----e

TODO - the automatic color is getting changed when a new window is opened.  it's switching to default (automatic) -- this only happened when opening a bunch of windows at once via the command line



TODO -- theme is not getting loaded from internal settings on load when settings file stored in weird place

NO -- actually, theme isn't getting saved to myGlobalData internal settings at atll!

look at setTheme()....

fffffff  sometimes settings files are stored in a weird place:
cd "/Users/stuartrobinson/Library/Application Support/Code/Workspaces/1556590758890"

when the extension loads.... after saving some settings.  we need to find the settings file.  check if it's in local dir or weird central place.

store this location as a global variable and reference it with the methods that return the settings location.

TODO - test everything in multiple windows now.


LATER:

TODO - what if workspace doesn't have write permissions?  vscode displays an error message like usual.  might be nice to display a more user friendly version so the extension doesn't look crappy.

TODO - when animation starts, the base color suddenly gets darker (try forestgreen)

TODO - open issue for changing the badge color. --- clean up all issues once loaded.

TODO - open issue:  set timestamp to know when to double up on colors

animation colors different from basecolor.  like titlebar color is different

150 ms is too fast for animation.

set some animations:

red gold green blue  <- dark rainbow rainbow



  "note": "use extension to view colors in vscode editor window: Color Highlight (naumovs.color-highlight)",
    "BaseColor": "#A52A2A",

//  #800080

TODO - makae black only profile
make animations profile

//TODO - clear all settings //TODO - clear all settings during reset including:
  "windowColors.AutomaticColorsPortfolio": "Easter Egg"



TODO - make animations portfolio
TODO - make user portfolio

TODO - clean up reset options


TODO - deal with themes.  


TODO - add more helpful checkmark emojis for current settings
- add to: 
-- Automatic 



LATER after release - in official roadmap:

TODO - badge color!  -  do this after release?  




Library 
- load colors
- save colors
- delete colors 
- new portfolio
- delete portfolio
- add base colors to portfolio (accept list of colors)
--- portfolio dropdown 
--- colors input 


^ done??


Settings ...... ?
- Reset ..........


Automatic Colors - Color each workspace automatically
- portfolio - Select a portfolio from which to color workspaces
- override all existing workspace colors
---- no/yes

^ need new config setting for this. AutomaticColorsPortfolio

-- to override existing workspace settings -- another global setting. T/F
WHEN setting this to true:
1.  go through and delete all myGlobalData objects that aren't members of the selected portfolio. 
2.  set a global variable for OVERRIDE or something and use this to confirm that the correct coloration is being loaded
each time a new workspace is opened.  






NEXT - need to write the code to pick an automatic color.  use portfolio options and compare to existing written colors. 


done: ? 

TODO -- handle overwriteAllWorkspaceColorsWithAutomaticPortfolio when opening the extension. -- what does this even mean


TODO - handle when same workspace opened in multiple times.  aka when settings.json file still exists when opening. and has full data -- NO.  pull from myglobaldata anyway.

TODO - add global config variable "overwriteWorkspaceWithAutomaticPortfolio" and select from Automatic command.  2 items in dropdown. 1) portfolios.  2) overwriteAllWorkspaceColorsWithAutomaticPortfolio?



TODO - accept background/foreground pairs as hex or hsl or rgb - no this is stupid

- TOOD - add automaticProfileColor object to internalSettings when colors get set to an automatic value
- TODO - clear automaticPortfolioAndColor when customizing any of the colors except theme


---- when are things customized:
---- Set Colors.  Animate.  that's it?

- TODO - need to undo selection after pressing ESCAPE in a dropdown color selector




 - make sure internal settings theme equals actual workspace theme.  or should it be nothing if user didn't set theme through WC?
 
 - remove unnecessary parse, stringify
 
 
 - new feature:  save current configuration


- theme picker


TODO - open vscode bug - when a value is changed to '#000000' - then vscode.ConfigurationChangeEvent doesn't trigger
- add lightness for custom theme
- add the name of the theme item in the input box description thingie


- going haywire.  lifecycle is fucked up.

now: get next steps for theme editor after selecting parameter
- add: 
  - THEME EDITOR: - should override all else.  so, should be set after other stuff.  be stored as object (map).
       { "<theme item>": {"baseColor": "#ff00ff", "saturation": 0.5, "lightness": 0.8}}
    - pick parameter (flash b/w on hover),  :( dont flash cos too messy when scrolling fast. just highlight 
    ---- AFTER picking parameter, show dropdown menu for following options:
    - pick color, 
    - pick sat, 
    - pick lightness 
    - enter color
  - animate: 1) rainbow. 2) input list of colors to blend between
             select speed 
  - save settigns to global on exit.  and delete settings.json 
             


- get global theme.  use this to shade automatic color

- foreground color:  set first option to "automatic".  for foreground sat and lightness, disable dropdown unless user has 
------- set a custom foreground color first. 

- set first value of all dropdowns to "Current Value (fosidfasdof)"


- model is messed up.  saturation can't save adjusted color as base color.  save saturation level and original unmodified base color.
-   - so saturation level is put on hue scroll later
- so how to trigger save if sat not saving basecolor?  the saturation level save.  
- yeah - trigger save on sat level and lightness change also.  scolling only modifies cc. 

- lightness next 
- how to make smoother scoll?
- deal with badge colors


next
- set inactive colors upon color selection 
- save settings more ofte - when?  how?  how avoid saving too much? like avoid saving per cc change.  do save per theme change and windowColors settings changes.
- update cc per settings change 
- saturation and lightness dropdowns
- font pickers
- how to uninstall ... add "reset workspace" command.  don't reset theme!

next 
 - how to format dropdowns
 - how to match shades of color and font colors with hue selection (store in map, pre-calculated)
 - how to set font color to change separately from background.  
 - can you change command options programmatically? like the title.  the %blahblahblah% method? no i don't think so https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/d546364e1e0a2f14d9356564a116ea3579035623/i18n-sample/package.nls.json

- use 3 options for toggling binary switches:
example:

Current Setting (on)
on
off

^^ so that top line will change based on current setting!  and selecting the option won't ruin things

--------------------------------

DO NOT TRY TO READ ANY MORE MANUALS

just download and build fucker's extension and reverse.  

but first move on to figuring out how to save to global user config file.


1.  always delete updated settings from settings.json and delete entire file & directory if possible.
2.  save color settings in global data in a map with key: workspace path
3.  prioritize command pallete for interacting with extension.  settings file stuff should be basically unused.  b a c k e n d 
4.  add these key words and in description:  "fun" "workspace"

FEATURE IDEA:  have different portfolio of colors.  wintry colors, fall colors, kookie sk8r colors, etc, basic boring colors. 
colors to match each vscode default profile.  or the main ones.  

HOW TO DETERMINE the user settings theme???? must be a way ... yeah there must be.  peacock is reading that file to get its favs.

what next ....

saving to global user config is main thing.
